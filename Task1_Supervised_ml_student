# TASK-1 Prediction using supervised ML
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: Predict the percentage of an student based on the 
#                    no. of study hours.
# THEORY: In this task simple linear regression is used that will predict
#         the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based
#         upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple
#         linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
